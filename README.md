## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

You can download the latest release of AutoClicker for Mac from the [Releases page](https://github.com/erikkostashuk/autoclicker-for-mac/releases) (link will be updated upon first release).

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build the application yourself, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/erikkostashuk/autoclicker-for-mac.git
    cd autoclicker-for-mac
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the app in development mode:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Package the application for distribution:**
    ```bash
    npm run dist
    ```
    This will create a distributable `.dmg` file in the `dist/` directory.

### Important: Enable Accessibility Permissions

For the autoclicker to function correctly, you **MUST** grant accessibility permissions to the application. When you first run the app, macOS will prompt you to grant these permissions. If you need to do it manually:

1.  Open **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** on older macOS versions) ‚Üí **Privacy & Security** ‚Üí **Accessibility**.
2.  Click the lock icon to make changes (you may need to enter your password).
3.  Find "AutoClicker" in the list and ensure its checkbox is **checked**.

### For Actual Clicking to Work (REQUIRED)

The application uses a compiled C program to perform clicks without moving the cursor. This is handled internally by the Electron app. However, for the initial setup and to ensure all permissions are correctly granted, the app might prompt you for Automation permissions.

### How It Works

AutoClicker for Mac utilizes macOS's native accessibility APIs to simulate mouse clicks at your current cursor position. This ensures high precision and compatibility with the operating system. Simply position your mouse cursor where you want the clicks to occur before starting the autoclicker.
